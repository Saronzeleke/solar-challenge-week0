 
## Task 2: Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA

This section covers exploratory data analysis for solar datasets from **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo**.  

Each analysis was conducted on separate branches (`eda-benin`, `eda-sierra_leone`, `eda-togo`) and saved in individual 

notebooks.

### Key steps performed

- Summary statistics and missing value profiling

- Outlier detection using Z-score 

- Data cleaning with median imputation

- Temporal trend analysis (GHI, DNI, DHI, Tamb)

- Cleaning impact visualization on module efficiency

- Correlation and scatter analysis

- Wind rose, distribution, and bubble plots

- Statistical measures: skewness and kurtosis

All cleaned datasets are stored locally under `/data` and excluded from Git tracking.
